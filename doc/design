Make a singly linked list library that can make a node holding a character array (a word)
and effectively manage and delete the information that is handed to it. The list will have a
queue like behavior and stack like behavior.

sizeoflist(structure * mylist)
	Take in a structure pointer (As a linklist pointer) and return the size of the structure  as an integer
	
push(struct linklist * my list, char * word)
	Push will make a node and set the nodes word to word. The linklist (NODE NOT YET INSERTED) will assign head nodes->next pointer
	and assign head to node.
